# Robotic Snake
Pour commencer voici une pr√©sentation de notre magnigique serpent: Flipper
## Motivation 
  These flexible and slithering machines excel at navigating complex and confined spaces, offering immense potential in various fields, including search and rescue operations, industrial inspections, exploration, medical applications, surveillance and security, and hazardous environments.

In search and rescue scenarios, robotic snakes play a crucial role. Unlike traditional robots, they excel at maneuvering through narrow and cluttered environments, such as collapsed buildings or debris. With their flexible bodies, they can easily navigate tight spaces, climb obstacles, and explore inaccessible areas. Equipped with cameras and sensors, these robots transmit real-time data, aiding rescuers in locating survivors and assessing surrounding conditions.

In the realm of medicine, robotic snakes hold promise as potential assistants in minimally invasive surgeries. Their flexible bodies and precise control enable access to hard-to-reach areas within the human body with minimal invasiveness. Surgeons can remotely control these robots, reducing the risk of complications and enhancing surgical outcomes in various medical specialties.

#### 1.Important features

The concept of the design is relatively simple, but there is some challenges. We had to design a joint, that allowed a good range of motion, at least from 0 to 180 degrees. Moreover, the servo needed a strong hold with minimum looseness. In order to do so we design an interlocking piece that locks together along one axis. Which allowed a maximum range of motion from -30 to 230 degree approxiamatly. For the servo we just designed a simple hold, in which we added four hole in order to screw the servos in. In those hole we had to put insert in order to have the thread pitch. This allowed the servo to have a firm grip and be really stable.

***2. Movement propagation***

Next challenge was the transmission of the movement from one piece to another. This is done along the axis of rotation of the servo. To drive the next piece, we used one of the mounting head of the servo and duplicated its shape on our piece, so that when we assemble two piece together we can had the servo head from the top, which completes the assembly. We picked the star shaped head, the idea was that with its many points of contact with the next piece, it would help a lot driving the movement. This showed to be really successful, however the implementation of the design took multiple tries due to the complexity of the shape. After trial and errors, we found a well fitting shape

 In order to have the piece fit well and not dislock, we also made an extrusion beneath the surface and a hole in the corresponding part of the second piece. This allow to have a good interlocking system. To limit friction between the pieces we added a bearing in which the extrusion comes to fit.

***3. Allowing movement***
Last but crucial point for the snake success is the addition of wheels. Indeed without this the snake would not go forward. It is due to the fact that the lateral friction created by the wheels forces the movement in one direction, and therefore allows it to move forward. It mimics what a real snake's scales does, increase friction in some direction. We really wanted to hide them as much as possible, to avoid people thinking they are driving the snake, instead of the undulated motion. The effort made to reduce their visibility result in a clean and elegant desgin.

***4. Thinking ahead***
The design is a cornerstone of the project. The smallest mistake could result in the failure of the entire project. We tried as much as possible to think about all possible problem that we could run into. One of them was cable management. In order to finish with a clean project we designed some hole in the piece that would let the cable run from tail to head. Unfortunately, we could not use them as the hole intended to accomplish this task were designed to small to fit the servo's end of the cable.
