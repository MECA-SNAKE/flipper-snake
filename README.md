# Robotic Snake
Pour commencer voici une pr√©sentation de notre magnigique serpent: Flipper
## Motivation 
  These flexible and slithering machines excel at navigating complex and confined spaces, offering immense potential in various fields, including search and rescue operations, industrial inspections, exploration, medical applications, surveillance and security, and hazardous environments.

In search and rescue scenarios, robotic snakes play a crucial role. Unlike traditional robots, they excel at maneuvering through narrow and cluttered environments, such as collapsed buildings or debris. With their flexible bodies, they can easily navigate tight spaces, climb obstacles, and explore inaccessible areas. Equipped with cameras and sensors, these robots transmit real-time data, aiding rescuers in locating survivors and assessing surrounding conditions.

In the realm of medicine, robotic snakes hold promise as potential assistants in minimally invasive surgeries. Their flexible bodies and precise control enable access to hard-to-reach areas within the human body with minimal invasiveness. Surgeons can remotely control these robots, reducing the risk of complications and enhancing surgical outcomes in various medical specialties.
